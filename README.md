The CASP10–13 decoy sets were directly downloaded from http://predictioncenter.org/download_area/. We selected and trimmed these decoy sets based on the following procedure:
(i) the prediction sets for targets without experimental structures are removed; 
(ii) the prediction sets whose target experimental structures are sequentially non-consecutive are removed;
(iii) all non-first prediction models (the second to fifth models of predictors) are removed;
(iv) the prediction models whose sequences are non-consecutive or shorter than the corresponding experimental structure are removed;
(v) all prediction models are trimmed to keep them identical in sequence to the corresponding experimental structure. As a result, the final decoy sets include 175 target proteins (a total of 13,474 structures).
